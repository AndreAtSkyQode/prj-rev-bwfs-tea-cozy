CODECADEMY:   Building Websites From Scratch
UNIT:         04 (Days 14-16)
PROJECT:      "Teac Cozy"
DESCRIPTION:  An unguided project to review our lessons on the CSS3 Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout), CSS Display & Position,
              and the Box Model.

              At this point you have experience positioning elements using the Box Model, CSS Display, and Flexbox. In this
              project you are provided you with a final website view containing style information that you will have to recreate
              on your local computer. Once you complete this you'll be ready for next week!

OBJECTIVE:    In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

              We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page
              outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions 
              for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

              The images and design spec you need to complete the project are listed below.
                Images (./resources/images):

TOP TIPS:
  1. Key Mindset to all CSS positioning problems:
        Important to break each component down into smaller components until you are working with a problem you've
        seen before and know how to solve. This mindset is the key to all CSS positioning problems.
